### Achievements
1. Our First idea is to create a calendar where people can sign up by clicking on the date. From there, they can see the different tutors. They can either see more information about the tutor or they can see different times that the tutor could work. They can click it and the schedule will be set up. We were able to create a web API. This allows the user to insert into google form all the information like there name, subject they want to work on, date of which they want to study, and the start and end time of each session. All this information updates to the calender so every single person on A2 Learning can see which day and time is taken.

2. The last thing that we want to include is a student progress item which would record students progress. This is what we have to implement as the 4th step.
Essentially, parents can log into their account and see how their child is doing in terms of tests and homework and stuff. They can see graphs about levels of the students and see how they are progressing. We created that through a database where the admin can enter in the students grades for parents to see and the parents can see the progression of the students work
