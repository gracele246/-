### Achievements
1. Our First idea is to create a calendar where people can sign up by clicking on the date. From there, they can see the different tutors. They can either see more information about the tutor or they can see different times that the tutor could work. They can click it and the schedule will be set up.

2. Our second idea is to create a login page. This will also work with the second item as people can just log in and sign up instead of typing their name and child and subject.
Once we create a database that can store people's login information, we will start create more user information places where parents can include information about their children and subject that they need help in so that the website can automatically filter out the perfect tutors for them.
From inside the account, users will be allowed to select what subject they want help on and the website will filter out tutors so that only their subject matches.
They will also be able to use this login to see their student's progress and see how well they are doing on tests and stuff that the teachers will directly input so that parents can see how students are progressing.

3. The last thing that we want to include is a student progress item which would record students progress. This is what we have to implement as the 4th step.
Essentially, parents can log into their account and see how their child is doing in terms of tests and homework and stuff. They can see graphs about levels of the students and see how they are progressing.
