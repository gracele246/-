Dear theshop, 

	My name is Abhijay Deevi and I am the president of A2LearningTree. I created this company to try and make the tutoring process much easier compared to individual tutoring. In addition to the decreased prices, we also wanted to make sure the tutors were perfect for the client. If the client ever felt like the tutor wasn’t good enough, then they would have the option to choose another tutor, rather than being forced to stick with the same tutor because of the lack of other tutors. 
	I asked your team to try and change the website because all I made was a pretty basic HTML + CSS website that basically just gave information on what A2LearningTree was all about. It included multiple pages that gave information and finally had a link where people could fill out their information on Google Forms. From there, I would have to look through the Google Form and try to contact them through email and phone number. Sometimes, the client wouldn’t even respond, making the entire process extremely difficult. I came to you guys because I wanted the website to have more interactivity to make it easier to sign up for classes. I required a calendar where people could easily schedule a time for their tutoring and I also wanted a place where people could easily set their information without having to go through the process of signing up through external links. I also wanted you guys to change the aesthetics of the website and try to make it look more fun while also being professional. 
	From what I can see, it looks like you guys created a pretty nice database where people can input their student id, their name, and their grade level. This is the idea that I wanted to see the most since that was the biggest struggle. The page looks really nice and it includes all the functions that I need. It also includes an edit function just in case they make a mistake. Everything is also stored in the database which is something that I like. I think this feature was done pretty well, so I give a check on that. 
	The next thing was the calendar. I was expecting this to be done pretty terribly since it was a hard thing to do. I stated that clients should be able to easily sign up for their classes without having to face any struggle. I wasn’t expecting too much from this, but you were able to include some sort of calendar which allows clients to schedule appointments. I think you guys could do a little more work on that, but overall it satisfies my requirements. 
	Finally, the last important thing was changing the design of the website. On my website, it seems kind of a classic and old fashioned type of website. I wanted to see different CSS properties to make the website look more modern and more aesthetically pleasing. Looks like you guys properly did that part as the website looks much nicer, especially with that navigation bar. There are also other effects like parallax which I really liked. Nice job! 
	Overall, I gave you guys three things to do. This included a database to include client information, a calendar to make fast and easy scheduling, and changing the aesthetics of the website. You guys completely surpassed my expectations and satisfied all my requirements.

Sincerely, 
Abhijay Deevi
