# The 商店 (Shop)

Pronounced "shāng diàn"

## 我们是什么 (What are we?)

We are the asian storekeepers!!! We created an asian store for everyone so that they can see the amazing asian products that they can buy right here from America! Our products range from food items all the way to different asian accessories.

Some of our ideas include having a marketplace page where people can buy different foods and items. We also have a currency exchange where you can turn white money to yellow money. (You can make money from playing our asian games!!!!!!). API that has chinese music where people can purchase different songs and play them to their heart's content. We also will create a database where people can save their information and save the items they have. We will also incorporate a google translate sort of thing where people can translate some english words into chinese.

Success Idea: The success is when we are able to get mostly the marketplace fully functional because that is the most important part of the project.
