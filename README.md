## What is A2LearningTree? 

A2LearningTree is a tutoring company! It's much better than private tutors and other companies because it's main focus us making the tutoring process fun, easy, and fast. The first benefit is that you can always choose the tutor and schedule a class based on the students' own schedule. Second, the tutors all understand exactly what they need to teach, since they all took that exact class in the past. This allows the tutor to teach at the correct pace, which helps the student understand the subject better. There are numerous high level tutors that teach various different subjects, allowing students to learn and understand anything that they choose.

Right now, we have a pretty basic HTML website where people can just see the information for the website, but there isn't much else that's interactive. In fact, we only have a Google Form to take in people's information. Everything else is static. We want to change this through our new features which can help fix that and make the scheduling and learning process much easier. 

Our First idea is to **create a calendar** where people can sign up by clicking on the date. From there, they can see the different tutors. They can either see more information about the tutor or they can see different times that the tutor could work. They can click it and the schedule will be set up.

Our second idea is to **create a login page**. This will also work with the second item as people can just log in and sign up instead of typing their name and child and subject. 

Once we create a database that can store people's login information, we will start create more **user information** places where parents can include information about their children and subject that they need help in so that the website can automatically filter out the perfect tutors for them. 

From inside the account, users will be allowed to select what subject they want help on and the website will filter out tutors so that only their subject matches. 

They will also be able to use this login to see their student's progress and see how well they are doing on tests and stuff that the teachers will directly input so that parents can see how students are progressing.

The last thing that we want to include is a **student progress item** which would record students progress. This is what we have to implement as the 4th step. 

Essentially, parents can log into their account and see how their child is doing in terms of tests and homework and stuff. They can see graphs about levels of the students and see how they are progressing.

This is currently what the website looks like. We want to completely change the design if possible and try to make the website more aesthetically pleasing.

**Success Idea**: Successfully create a self-sufficient website where people can easily sign up for classes without any difficulties.
